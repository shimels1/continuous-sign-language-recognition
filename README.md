## Overview

This project aims to develop a continuous Ethiopian Sign Language (EthSL) recognition system using BiLSTM and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). It incorporates advanced data processing techniques to enhance sign language recognition by extracting meaningful features from video sequences, preprocessing raw data for better model efficiency, and implementing deep learning architectures for accurate and seamless recognition. The project involves dataset collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, ensuring a robust system that can interpret continuous EthSL gestures effectively. The goal is to provide an efficient and scalable solution for recognizing Ethiopian Sign Language from video sequences.
